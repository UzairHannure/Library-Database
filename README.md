# Report Card-Database

OBJECTVE

My final high school project that aims to create a student report card database system that is capable of adding students’ marks in the five core subjects, calculate the percentage, calculate grade and assign a roll number to them. It should be capable of modifying their information, deleting records, searching for records using roll number, displaying all records in both list form and tabular form. It should have an interface that is mobile and easy to use.

DESCRIPTION

The student report card database system is created using C++, and optimally uses file handling, classes, functions, and constructors to achieve various functions. Firstly, there is an introduction page which was made simply using the tab and new line operators, secondly there is the option to see results, add/modify data, and exit the program. This was created using simple switch case. If we visit the results section, there is the option to see an individual record using the person’s roll no. And also to see all the records in a tabular format. In the modify/add section we can add more persons to the database, we can modify existing records, by searching for the roll no. And then rewriting the selected record. You can also delete existing records. You can also exit to the main menu and exit from the main function, for this the exit() function has been used instead of a loop, or switch. You can also view record in tabular format in case you want to see all the values, before you edit the individual’s record. The interface is simple and easy to navigate and textcolor() function was used to make text orange color.
